# Cryptographic IP cores by Tohoku University Cryptographic Hardware Project

##  What is this?

This repository contains the cryptographic IP cores developed by Tohoku University and AIST around 2007--2012. The source codes and document had been distributed by the Cryptographic Hardware Project of the Aoki Laboratory at Tohoku University at [http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/crypto/web/cores.html](http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/crypto/web/cores.html).
Then, the distribution page is migrated to github and maintained by the same authors, [ECSIS laboratory at Tohoku University](TBD). The source codes are unmodified from the original distribution.

## What are included?

The independent projects are separated into subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a brief description about the impelementation in README.
