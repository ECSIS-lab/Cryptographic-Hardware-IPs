# Cryptographic IP cores by Tohoku University Cryptographic Hardware Project

##  What is this?

This repository contains the cryptographic IP cores developed by Tohoku University and AIST around 2007--2012. The Cryptographic Hardware Project of the Aoki Laboratory at Tohoku University previously distributed the source codes and documents at [http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/crypto/web/cores.html](http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/crypto/web/cores.html).
The distribution is migrated to this GitHub repository and maintained by the same authors, [ECSIS Laboratory at Tohoku University](https://www.ecsis.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/views/index-e). The files are unmodified from the original distribution.

## What are included?

The implementations and documents are separated into subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a brief description about the contents in README.md.

## How to cite it?

Please use the following bibtex entry to cite the entire repository. The README files in each subdirectory also shows the paper the corresponding IP appeared.
